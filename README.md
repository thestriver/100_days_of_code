Day 1:

Day 6:
---------------

**Project:** Building a Restaurant Menu backend application with AWS Amplify 

**Thoughts:** Always wanted to deploy a AWS cloud app so this short setup is a nice intro. Ran into some challenges though and I hope to fix them soon. 


Day 7:
---------------

**Project:** Side-Projects 1.0 | Python 

**Thoughts:** Started the day with some Python coding. Python is my second language of choice. Also started work on a side project I'm working on. That would be side project 1 of 12.  


Day 8:
---------------

**Project:** Side-Project 1.1

**Thoughts:** Spent the day completing the front end section on a side project I'm working on. Need to integrate a payment system to make it functional.


Day 9:
---------------

**Project:** Side-Project 1.2

**Thoughts:** Converted the side project to a Vue app. 


Day 10:
---------------

**Project:** Side-Project 1.3

**Thoughts:** Finished work on the Vue app conversion. Also fixed some styling issues. It's my first time working with Vue + Tailwind so there was a couple of errors to fix. 


Day 11:
---------------

**Project:** Side-Project 1.4

**Thoughts:** Integrated a test payment processing functionality into it. Also explored other options of better integrating micro crowdfunding payments. Need to spend more time doing that.  


Day 12:
---------------

**Project:** Location App with AWS Amplify and Amazon Location services. 

**Thoughts:** Worked on a nice and short overview of AWS AMplify and the new location services released by Aamazon. This made it easy for anyone to build a map displaying specified coordinates. The react app also included a search functionality enabling anyone to input a location and be able to view its map. I hope to extend the map's functionality such as asking the users for clarification for name of cities in different states/countries. 

Day 13:
---------------

**Project:** Portfolio Revamp
